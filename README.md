* The [semistandard](https://github.com/standard/semistandard) should be used, to ensure that the code will follow the same standard.
* Before each commit, husky runs tasks to standardize the code correctly.
* Tests are performed on the staged files, and if the tests are not ok, the commit will be canceled.

```
$ git commit -m "some awesome feature"

husky > pre-commit (node v12.4.0)
â€¼ Some of your tasks use `git add` command. Please remove it from the config since 
all modifications made by tasks will be automatically added to the git commit index.
